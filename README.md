# MockWebsite
Mock Website Sample for learning Tag Structure

Prerequisites: Text Editor to make changes, WebBrowser to see Client View, Apache2 or Nginx for hosting. Make sure whatever image you're using is hosted in the /var/www/html/ directory, or that the appropriate user has read privledges to your final path. 

Necessary changes: Make sure to change the img src reference file, as well as any changes needed to the structure and context of the site. This is a very simple site, and designed as such.
